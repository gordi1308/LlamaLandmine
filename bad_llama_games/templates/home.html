<h3 id="sub_heading">About the game</h3>
	<p id="body"> It's 2016 and war has broken out across Europe.
	The death toll has already surpassed 1 million and is rising by the day. 
	Portuguese Rebels have launched an invasion into Spain and the Spanish 
	defenses are crumbling under the relentless assault. Germany insurrections 
	have overthrown the government and  Swedish cartels now control most of 
	Scandinavia. With hopes of peace and justice fading fast, the continent 
	finds itself crying out for a hero to save them from total destruction...
			
	Meanwhile a herd of Peruvian Llamas have wandered into a nuclear minefield!
